## Simple calculator application.
A simple, fully functional calculator application I built using React both for fun and as a learning experience with the library.

The demo was built on Codepen and was well received, attracting many views, likes and comments which was really encouraging.

You can view the demo on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/alexboffey/pen/NAkQLE "React calculator demo").
