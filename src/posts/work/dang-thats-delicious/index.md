## Full stack Node JS Application

So far along my web development journey I have mainly focussed solely on the front end, so I thought it is now time to learn and gain some experience doing some work on the back end too!

This application is actually what I built along with [Wes Bos' Learn Node course](https://learnnode.com/), which I would highly reccomend for anyone who is looking to well... learn Node js!

If you want to see the deployed application, here is the [link](https://dang-thats-delicious-rtpuctuozb.now.sh/).

## Application Features

To give an overview of what the application can do, users of the application can review, favourite and upload restaurants, bars, cafes and the like so other users of the application can browse and discover them.

The application contains many features that users would expect from a modern web application, which made for a great learning experience!
